# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
  The purpose of this analysis is to determine credit risk of the loan data utilizing different sampling and machine-learning models, including Random Oversampling, SMOTE Oversampling, Cluster Centroids, SMOTEEN, Balanced Forest Random Classifier, and Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier.  

## Results:
